# sequences: string, lists, and tuples -> lists are more common than tuples because it's mutable, has methods like sort, reverse
  If you are passing a sequence as an argument to a function, using tuples reduces the potential for unexpected behavior due to aliasing.         
  For a temporary variable that you will use and discard without modifying 
  However Python provides the built-in functions sorted and reversed, 
  which take any sequence as a parameter and return a new list with the same elements in a different order
# reading, running, ruminating, retreating
  Immutable types like integers, floats and strings are hashable; mutable types like lists and dictionaries are not

pop() # If no index is specified, a.pop() removes and returns the last item in the list. https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html
index() method works both in lists and tuples
